## ez-ssg

I created [my personal website](https://chettriyuvraj.github.io/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a while back.

For a minimal website like mine, Jekyll felt like a bit of a main to set up.

Since I already knew the theme and styling I wanted, I decided to write my own little static-site-generator.

Want a static site like chettriyuvraj.github.io? Generate it in 5 minutes using _ez-ssg_.

## How will the static site look?

A quick look at my static website:

**Home page**

![Home page of my static website](/images/indexpage.png)

**Blog page**

- Note how you can also see available 'tags' at the end of the listing

**Blog post**

**Tags page**

- Clicking on a particular tag at the bottom of the _blog_ page brings us to this section.

## How to use ez-ssg to generate my static website?

### Organize your content

Just provide the content, _ez-ssg_ will do the rest.

_ez-ssg_ is opinionated on how you need to structure your content directory.

Simply run the following command to give you a markdown folder organized in the correct manner:

```
ez-ssg init
```

```
markdown/
├── assets
│   ├── favicon.io
│   ├── images
│       ├── img1.png
│       ├── img2.png
|
└── posts
|    ├── Understanding_inferfaces.md
|    ├── Life_Lately.md
|
└── tags
|    ├── Understanding_inferfaces.md
|    ├── Life_Lately.md
|
└── blog.md
└── index.md
└── config.json
```
- _markdown_ is the name of the top level directory
- _assets_ contain images and favicon (site thumbnail)
- _posts_ contain markdown files for blog posts
- _tags_ contain json files for tags - e.g. your create a post and want to categorize it under the tag _programming_
- _blog.md_ contains content written on top of the blog listings page
- _index.md_ contains content written on the homepage
- _config.json_ contains some site configs which need to be filled in by the user

### Home page

The _index.md_ page is autogenerated on running _ez-ssg init_ and simply needs some content.

Fill in the data and metadata. The _tags_ array is not relevant for this page.

### Blog listings page

The _blog.md_ page is autogenerated on running _ez-ssg init_ and simply needs some content.

Fill in the data and metadata. The _tags_ array is not relevant for this page:

Blog posts will be populated automatically when generating the site.

### Config

The _config.json_ file is filled with the following sample configs:

![The config json file sample](/images/config_example.png)

You can look at the screenshots of my website above and fill it up as follows:

- The _title_ is what shows up as an h2 header on top of your homepage

- The _description_ is used as a meta header

- The _URL_ is used for serving the website, use _http://localhost:3000_ when generating it to serve it locally using _ez-ssg serve_ and change it to your website's actual URL when generating it to serve online. (Generation using _ez-ssg generate_ command explained ahead.)

- _special_links_ show up alongside the _Home_ and _Blog_ pages as a navbar.

- _paths_ can be left untouched

- You can add your tracking id inside _google_analytics_ if you want to.


### Create a new post

Run the following command - provide the post title and any optional tags.

```
ez-ssg post "Understanding interfaces via Golang" -t programming golang
```

This will genereate a post markdown file of the following form.

![A sample post markdown file](/images/post_example.png)

Fill in the content - you can add images to the _markdown/assets/images_ folder and reference them in this manner:

![A sample post markdown file referencing an image in the assets folder](/images/postimage_example.png)


### Create a new tag

You created a post under the _programming_ and _golang_ tag. 

However you have to create the corresponding tag for it to be displayed on the blog page as a filter.

```
ez-ssg tag programming golang
```

This creates two tag json files under the _tags_ folder which look like:

![A sample tags json file](/images/tags_example.png)

You can create more tags if you want. Create a post under a tag and then create the tag - or vice versa.


### Fill up config.json

Fill up _config.json_ as described in [this section](#config)


### Images and favicon

- Double check if you have added images and favicon correctly in the _assets_ folde.r


### Generate static site

Finally, you can generate a static site using the following command:

```
ez-ssg generate
```



This will generate a folder as follows:

![The blog listings page markdown file](/images/staticgenerate_example.png)


### Serve static site locally

To see what you created:

```
ez-ssg serve <port number>
```

Note that you must change the _URL_ field in _config.json_ to _http://localhost:<port_number>_ when serving locally


## Modes

We have two modes, command-line mode and a GUI mode.
